## The tentative project title:

World Life Expectancy—Live to thrive

## The motivation for this project:

It’s a survival instinct in blood that keeps us asking ourselves, how do
we live, and how do we live longer. People in different regions have
different life expectancies. Even in New York, life expectancy varies
over regions due to different economic statuses, different
infrastructures, etc. It is natural to wonder about the factors that
could potentially have the most influential impact on life expectancy:
social-economic factors, public health factors, or both.
