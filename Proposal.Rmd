## The tentative project title:
World Life Expectancy—Live to thrive
 
## The motivation for this project:
It's a survival instinct in blood that keeps us asking ourselves, how do we live, and how do we live longer. People in different regions have different life expectancies. Even in New York, life expectancy varies over regions due to different economic statuses, different infrastructures, etc. It is natural to wonder about the factors that could potentially have the most influential impact on life expectancy: social-economic factors, public health factors, or both. 



## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

#### Analyses:

  * Hypothesis test : difference in mean life expectancy among regions, e.g. developed v.s. developing countries
  * Linear model : Fit a linear model with Y = life expectancy and X=economic/environmental / health determinants  
                        
#### Visualizations:

  * EDA Plots: variable distribution / scatter plots with best line fit / correlation plot of variable
  * Time Series Plot : life expectancy over time
  * Interactive World Map : life expectancy in different countries and years
  
  
#### Challenges : 

  * Missing data：Many variables in our major dataset have missing values
Select reasonable variables: We need to find more variables for our dataset, in order to cover aspects of society, economics, environment, health, and so on.
  * Website Design : We want to build a fancier website with advanced settings
  * R-Shiny interactive dashboard : We plan to use R-Shiny to build an interactive platform.
  * Model fitting : Our dataset contains many predictors of life expectancy. Variable selection and interpretation could be a challenge
